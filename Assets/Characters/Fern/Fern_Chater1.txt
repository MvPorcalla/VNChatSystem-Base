System: "7:15 AM"

Fern: "Good morning."
Fern: "I hope I'm not disturbing you this early."
Fern: "Frieren-sama is still asleep, and I found myself with some time before I need to prepare breakfast."

Player: "..."

Fern: "I've been traveling with Frieren-sama for years now."
Fern: "Watching her sleep in until noon, forgetting to eat, losing track of time..."
Fern: "Sometimes I wonder if she'd even notice if I wasn't here."

-> ...

Player: "I'm sure she notices"

Fern: "...Perhaps you're right."
Fern: "She just has her own way of showing it."
Fern: "Still, there are moments when I feel..."

Fern: "...Yes."
Fern: "That's exactly it."
Fern: "Frieren-sama can spend days lost in thought about magic, or staring at flowers that only bloom once every fifty years."
Fern: "And I'm here, in the present, watching time pass by."

Player: "..."

Fern: "I know she cares. She took me in when I had no one."
Fern: "Heiter-sama entrusted me to her before he passed."
Fern: "But sometimes..."
Fern: "Sometimes I wish she would see me as I am now, not just as the child she once knew."

-> ...

Player: "You've grown a lot"

Fern: "Have I?"
Fern: "Maybe that's why I wanted to talk to someone today."
Fern: "Someone who exists in the same timeframe as me."
Fern: "Thank you for listening without judgment."

Fern: "I wouldn't say unappreciated..."
Fern: "Frieren-sama relies on me more than she realizes."
Fern: "I make sure she eats, that we have supplies, that she doesn't wander off for three days chasing a rumor about some grimoire."

-> ...

Player: "That sounds exhausting"

Fern: "It can be."
Fern: "But it's also... meaningful."
Fern: "Heiter-sama once told me that caring for others is how we find purpose."

Player: "..."

Fern: "I think he was right."
Fern: "Even when Frieren-sama forgets my birthday, or doesn't notice I changed my hairstyle..."
Fern: "I know she needs me."
Fern: "And maybe I need to be needed."

-> ...

Player: "That's a beautiful way to see it"

Fern: "You think so?"
Fern: "Sometimes I worry I'm just making excuses."
Fern: "But talking to you... it helps clarify things."

Fern: "I should go now."
Fern: "Frieren-sama will wake up soon, and if breakfast isn't ready, she'll try to eat those weird mushrooms from the forest again."
Fern: "The last time that happened, we lost two days."

-> ...

Player: "Good luck with that"

Fern: "Thank you."
Fern: "And... thank you for this conversation."
Fern: "It's rare for me to talk about these things."
Fern: "Perhaps we can speak again sometime?"

System: "Later that evening."
