TestNPC: "Hey! Good morning. I wanted to check if our test chat system is working properly."
TestNPC: "I've prepared a bunch of messages to see how everything displays, including long texts, media bubbles, and branching choices."
TestNPC: "Let's see if all the chat bubbles align correctly and the CG unlock feature works as intended."
>> media npc type:image unlock:true path:TestNPC_CG1.png       // Unlockable CG for gallery

-> ...                                                      // Tap to continue

Player: "..."
TestNPC: "Here's a longer message to test the text wrapping and scrolling behavior in the chat system."
TestNPC: "We want to make sure that messages of various lengths don't break the bubble layout or overlap other UI elements. This includes messages with emojis 😊😂👍 and special characters like #, @, $, &."

TestNPC: "Ah, so polite! I like that. 😊"
TestNPC: "Let's continue the test with even more text to see if everything scrolls properly."
TestNPC: "Also, check this unlockable CG, it should appear in the gallery after this bubble."
