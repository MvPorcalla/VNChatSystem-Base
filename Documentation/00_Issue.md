## Prompt

Here’s the corrected and clearer version:

---

i have this issue where if i go out at mid convo and comback it show this `-> ...` button and if i press it it show the choice button or end button
it shouldnt do that it show the choice or end button right away `-> ...` this should only show if its a continue button

TODO:

simplify GalleryFullscreenViewer.cs

the backbutton in the PhoneHomescreen when i open full screen it directly send it back to homescreenpanel instead of back to gallerypanel like the closebutton
it should be when i open the fullscreen of image when iback from the phonehomescreen.cs 
fullscreen -> gallerypanel -> homescreen

consider making a GalleryController and put all the script there
