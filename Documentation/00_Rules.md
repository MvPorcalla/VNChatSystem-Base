**Important RULE:**
* Before refactoring, reviewing, or suggesting changes to any code, always ask me if you need the full script or relevant context.
* Do **not** assume or invent code. Refactor only based on code I explicitly provide.

* The **Modules/System** folder should contain **only pure data logic** (no UI, scenes, or presentation code).
* All UI presentation logic should always go in the **UI** folder.
